# Ballerina Blocking Queue

A blocking queue is a queue that supports operations to wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an element and to wait for space to become available in the queue when adding an element. This implementation of a blocking queue is based on a circular buffer with thread-safe access using a `ReentrantLock`.

## Quickstart

To use the `blockingqueue` in your Ballerina project, modify the `.bal` file as follows:

### Step 1: Import the module

Import the `ayash/blockingqueue` module into your Ballerina project.

```ballerina
import ayash/blockingqueue;
```

### Step 2: Instantiate a new class

The constructor initializes the queue with a specified capacity.

```ballerina
blockingqueue:BlockingQueue queue = new blockingqueue:BlockingQueue(5);
```

### Step 3: Run the Ballerina application

Use the following command to compile and run the Ballerina program.

```bash
bal run
```

## Build from the source

### Setting up the prerequisites

1. Download and install Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 17. You can download it from either of the following sources:

    * [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
    * [OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/)

   > **Note:** After installation, remember to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the directory where JDK was installed.

2. Download and install [Ballerina Swan Lake](https://ballerina.io/).

3. Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

   > **Note**: Ensure that the Docker daemon is running before executing any tests.

4. Export Github Personal access token with read package permissions as follows,

    ```bash
    export packageUser=<Username>
    export packagePAT=<Personal access token>
    ```

### Build options

Execute the commands below to build from the source.

1. To build the package:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build
   ```

2. To run the tests:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean test
   ```

3. To build the without the tests:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build -x test
   ```

4. To run tests against different environments:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean test -Pgroups=<Comma separated groups/test cases>
   ```

5. To debug the package with a remote debugger:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build -Pdebug=<port>
   ```

6. To debug with the Ballerina language:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build -PbalJavaDebug=<port>
   ```

7. Publish the generated artifacts to the local Ballerina Central repository:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean build -PpublishToLocalCentral=true
    ```

8. Publish the generated artifacts to the Ballerina Central repository:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build -PpublishToCentral=true
   ```
